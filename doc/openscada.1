.SH NAME
openscada \- Main \fBOpenSCADA\fP start program
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBopenscada\fP [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBOpenSCADA\fP system is an open implementation of SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) and HMI (Human-Machine Interface) systems.
The main properties of the system are: openness(GPL), multiplatform, modularity and scalability.
.sp 1
Heart of the system is the modular kernel.
Depending on what modules are connected, the system can carry out both functions of various servers,
and functions of clients of client-server architecture.
Actually, the architecture of system allows you to realize the distributed client-server systems of any complexity and mixing.
For achievement of high speed due to reduction of communications time, the architecture allows to unite functions of the distributed systems
into one program.
.sp 1
The program \fBopenscada\fP is main starter and it allows you to start \fBOpenSCADA\fP into need configuration (default into file \fI/etc/oscada.xml\fP)
whether into full-featured SCADA or PLC and demon mode. For flexible control use the projects oriented wrapper \fBopenscada_start\fP.
.sp 1
For access to default configurations use account "root" and password "openscada" or account "user" and password "user".
