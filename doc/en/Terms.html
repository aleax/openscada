<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Terms_and_definitions"><span class="mw-headline-number">1</span> Terms and definitions</span></h3>
<ul><li> <i>Blocking</i> — a conditional border of the technological parameter value at which overcome there performs a preset algorithm for the emergency prevent. In some modes of TP (starting) according to the regulations you can be needed for the blockings disable — deblocking.</li>
<li> <i>Deblocking</i> — the process of the blockings disabling on time of TP working in modes for which the operation reserved into the regulations. The technological parameters deblocking is strictly accountable operation and it must be performed by the operative personal in an appropriate order!</li>
<li> <i>Complex parameter-tag or object-tag of the signal</i> — detailed signal of the data source as a complex parameter-tag, which for analog one usually contains:
<ul><li> signal value in the engineering-real measurement unit;</li>
<li> name of the measurement unit;</li>
<li> scale-range of the signal value physical changing - minimum and maximum borders;</li>
<li> signaling scale borders — usually the upper and lower boundaries for warning and alarms;</li>
<li> filter parameters;</li>
<li> parameters of the scale specifics, determining the authenticity, format of presentation and more.</li></ul></li>
<li> <i>Data model</i> — organization and structuring of the technological process (TP) data or other automation object in the layer of SCADA data source, protocol or PLC. By default, this means <a href="Program_manual.html#DAQ" title="Special:MyLanguage/Documents/Program manual">OpenSCADA data source layer</a> with the structure "Controller object" -&gt; "Parameter, Level 1" -&gt; ... "Parameter, Level N" -&gt; "Attribute of value - signal".</li>
<li> <i>Project</i> — this term has many meanings and, depending on the context, may be implied:
<ul><li> <i>OpenSCADA project (program)</i> — free software, the documentation of which you are reading now.</li>
<li> <a href="Program_manual.html#Projects" title="Special:MyLanguage/Documents/Program manual">Specified set-folder of the configuration and data</a> that are created by the user of OpenSCADA, where the configuration is stored in the configuration file (required) and one or more DB files (optionally and maybe online). For example — a demonstration project, simulator of the TP "AGLKS". That is, the author of the project is the user of the program — the engineer-developer or programmer of the SCADA system.</li>
<li> <i><a href="Modules/VCAEngine.html#Project" title="Special:MyLanguage/Modules/VCAEngine">VCA project</a></i> — a component of the visualization control area (VCA) created in the module <a href="Modules/VCAEngine.html" title="Special:MyLanguage/Modules/VCAEngine">UI.VCAEngine</a> through <a href="Modules/Vision.html" title="Special:MyLanguage/Modules/Vision">UI.Vision</a> and contains a set of VCA frames.</li></ul></li>
<li> <i>Qt</i> — software development tool, with which, in particular, the QTStarter (starter of OpenSCADA modules on the library Qt), QTCfg (GUI configurator of OpenSCADA) and Vision (editor and executant of the working user interfaces of VCA) modules are created. It may be encountered in the form of <i>QT</i>, which is an early entry used by OpenSCADA developers for the Qt library.</li>
<li> <i>Quietance</i> — approving process is a fact of the operative personal take its attention to the violation into the TP work. The process mostly means of take actions for the violation eliminating and pressing to the button of the alarm quieting.</li>
<li> <i>Setting of the alarm</i> — a conditional border of the technological parameter value at which overcome means as an abnormal situation. Typically there set next borders:
<ul><li> <i>Upper and bottom alarm borders</i> — borders of alarm values of the technological parameter.</li>
<li> <i>Upper and bottom warning borders</i> — borders of warning, the regulations borders, about the parameter value exit beyond the work range.</li>
<li> <i>Failure</i> — points to the parameter value out of hardware borders of the technological equipment. That is mostly features to the sensor failure, break of the channel link with the sensor or the PLC.</li></ul></li>
<li> <i>Signal (in relation to the data source)</i> — element of the data source in the form of measured, or calculated, value of the technological parameter or sensor. Represents a scalar of a discrete, integer or real type, which is often encoded, by scaling the parameter scale to the integer dimension. The signal, for identification, is often simply indexed or encoded at the address of its value on the map of the exchanging protocol, and the meaningful name appears in the SCADA data model.</li>
<li> <i>Signaling</i> — the process of notification of the operative personal about a violation of the technological process or the automation equipment work. The notification methods can be at different types of influence to the human senses for take it attention. There often provides next types of signaling:
<ul><li> <i>Light signaling</i> — that is typically performed by changing color of the graphical object (blink) for the emerging events and by setting the static alarm colors (red and yellow) for events have quietance-confirmation.</li>
<li> <i>Sound</i> — that is performed by sound signal out in moment of the event emerge. The sound signal type can be both as monotonic and the speech synth message with an information about the violation.</li></ul></li>
<li> <i>VCA frame</i> — derived visualization element, consisting of the basic elements and able to serve functions of the project page of VCA.</li>
<li> <i>VCA widget</i> — visualization element of the VCA.</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Used_abbreviations"><span class="mw-headline-number">2</span> Used abbreviations</span></h3>
<ul><li> API — Application Programming Interface (OpenSCADA modules) or extensions in the internal language of OpenSCADA — <a href="User_API.html" title="Special:MyLanguage/Documents/User API">User API</a>.</li>
<li> AWP — Automated Work Place. Usually it is a system unit of a computer system, a display, a mouse "manipulator", sometimes with a keyboard, and other peripheral equipment, which serves to visualize the data of the technological process, as well as the issuance of control actions on the TP.</li>
