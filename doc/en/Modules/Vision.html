<p>Vision module provides a mechanism of the final visualization control area (VCA) into the OpenSCADA. The module is based on the multi-platform library of graphical user interface (GUI) of firm TrollTech — Qt (<a class="external free" href="http://www.trolltech.com/qt" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">http://www.trolltech.com/qt</a>). In its work, the module uses the data of the VCA engine (module <a href="../Modules/VCAEngine.html" title="Special:MyLanguage/Modules/VCAEngine">VCAEngine</a>).
</p><p>Visual control area (VCA) is an integral part of the SCADA system. It applies to the client stations with a view to providing accessible information about the object and to for the the issuance of the control actions to the object. In various practical situations and conditions the VCA, based on different principles of visualization may by applied. For example, this may be the library of widgets Qt, GTK+,  wxWidgets or hypertext mechanisms based technologies HTML, XHTML, XML, CSS, and JavaScript, or third-party applications of visualization, realized in various programming languages Java, Python, etc. Any of these principles has its advantages and disadvantages, the combination of which could become an insurmountable obstacle to the use of VCA in a practical case. For example, technologies like the Qt library can create highly-reactive VCA, which will undoubtedly important for the operator station for control of technological processes (TP). However, the need for installation of that client software in some cases may make using of it impossible. On the other hand, Web-technology does not require installation on client systems and is extremely multi-platform (it is enough to create a link to the Web-server at any Web-browser) that is most important for various engineering and administrative stations, but the responsiveness and reliability of such interfaces is lower that actually eliminates the using of them at the operator of the TP stations.
</p><p>OpenSCADA system has extremely flexible architecture that allows you to create external interfaces, including user and in any manner and for any taste. For example, the system configuration OpenSCADA as now available as by means of the Qt library, and also the Web-based.
</p><p>At the same time creation of an independent implementation of the VCA in different basis may cause the inability to use the configuration of one VCA into another one. That is inconvenient and limited from the user side, as well as costly in terms of implementation and follow-up support. In order to avoid these problems, as well as to create as soon as possible the full spectrum of different types of VCA 
<a class="external" href="http://oscada.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Sub-projects/VCA" title="Special:MyLanguage/Sub-projects/VCA">the project of conception of the Visual Control Area (VCA)</a> is established. The result of this project — the direct visualization module (based on the library Qt), direct visualization module <a href="../Modules/WebVision.html" title="Special:MyLanguage/Modules/WebVision">WebVision</a> and VCA engine <a href="../Modules/VCAEngine.html" title="Special:MyLanguage/Modules/VCAEngine">VCAEngine</a>.

<li> the possibility of the inclusion of the functions(or frames of computing of the functions) of the object model of OpenSCADA to the user elements of the visualization, actually linking the presentation of the algorithm of computing (for example, by visualizing the library of models of devices of TP for following visual modeling TP);</li>
<li> separation of user interfaces and interfaces of visualization of data provides building the user interface in a single environment, and performance of it in many others (Qt, Web, Java ...);</li>
<li>the possibility to connect to the performing interface for monitoring and corrective actions (for example, while operator training and control in real time for his actions);</li>
<li> Visual building of various schemes with the superposition of the logical links and the subsequent centralized execution in the background (visual construction and performance of mathematical models, logic circuits, relay circuits and other proceedings);</li>
<li> providing of the the functions of the object API to the OpenSCADA system, it can be used to control the properties of the visualization interface from the user procedures;</li>
<li> building of the servers of frames, of elements of the visualization and of the project of the interfaces of the visualization with the possibility to serve the great number of the client connections;</li>
<li> simple organization of client stations in different basis (Qt, Web, Java ...) with the connection to the central server;</li>
<li> full mechanism of separation of privileges between the users which allows to create and execute projects with the various rights of access to its components;</li>
<li> adaptive formation of alarms and notifications, with the support of different ways of notification;</li>

<li> support of the user formation of maps of the events under the various items of equipment management and user preferences;</li>
<li> support for user profiles, allowing to define various properties of the visualization interface (colors, font characteristics, the preferred maps of events);</li>
<li> flexible storage and distribution of libraries of widgets, frames, and projects of the visualization interfaces in the databases, supported by OpenSCADA; actually users need only to register the database with data.</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Tool_of_the_graphical_formation_of_the_VCA_interface"><span class="mw-headline-number">2</span> Tool of the graphical formation of the VCA interface</span></h2>
<p>Development of the VCA interface is performed in a single window, realizing many documents interface (MDI) interface (Fig. 2.a). This approach allows you to simultaneously open multiple frames of various sizes. The following mechanisms for managing the development are used: toolbars, menus and context menus. Most actions are duplicated by different mechanisms, that allows you to quickly find the tool by the preferred method. Navigational interfaces are implemented by the attached windows. Configuration if the toolbars and attached windows is saved on exit and restored at startup that lets you to customize the interface for yourself.

<p>At the bottom of the development window of the VCA there is the status line. On the right side of the status line there are indicators of the visual scale of the edited frame, of the mode of changing of the size of the elements, of the mode of the current page of the of the VCA engine station and the user on whose behalf the development of the VCA interface is done. By double-clicking on the indicator of the user it can be changed the current user, enter the new username and password. In the main field of the status line it is displayed various information and assistance messages.
</p><p>To edit the properties of the visual elements there are two dialogues. The first dialogue allows you to edit the properties of containers of visual elements (widget libraries and projects), figure 2.b. The second dialogue serves to edit the properties of the visual elements, Fig. 2.d. Changes, made in the dialogues, at once, get to the VCA engine. To save these changes to the database or restore from the database it is necessary to use the appropriate tools of the main development window.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Styles"><span class="mw-headline-number">2.1</span> Styles</span></h3>
<p>It is known that people can have individual characteristics in the perception of graphical information. If these features are not taken into account it is possible to get the rejection and exclusion of the user to the VC interface. Such rejection and exclusion can lead to fatal errors in the management of TP, as well as traumatize the human by the permanent working with the such interface. In SCADA systems it is accepted the agreement, which regulate the requirements for establishing a unified VC interface which is normally perceived by most of people. The people with some deviations are not taken into account.
</p><p>To take this into account, and provide the ability to centrally and easily change the visual properties of the interface, the project provides the implementation of visualization interface styles manager.
</p><p>User can create many styles, each of which will hold the color, font and other properties of the elements of the frame. A simple change of style will quickly transform the VC interface, and the possibility of appointing an individual style to the user will take into account his individual characteristics.
</p><p>To realize this opportunity, when you create a frame, it is necessary for the properties of color, font and others set the "Config" ( of the table if the "process" tab) in the value of "From style". And in the parameter "Config template" to specify the identifier of the style field. Further, this field will automatically appear in the Style Manager and will be there to change. Style Manager is available on the project configuration page in the tab "Styles" (Figure next). On this tab you can create new styles, delete old ones, change the field of the style and delete unnecessary.
</p>

<p>In general the styles are available from the project level. At the level of libraries of widgets you can only define styles fields of widgets. At the project level, at the choice of style it is started the work with styles, which includes access to the fields of styles instead of direct attribute values. In fact, this means that when reading or writing a widget attribute these operations will be carried out with the corresponding field of the chosen style.
</p><p>When you run the project execution it will be used the set in the project style. Subsequently, the user can select a style from the list of available ones. The user's style will be saved and used next time you run the project.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Linkage_with_the_dynamics"><span class="mw-headline-number">2.2</span> Linkage with the dynamics</span></h3>
<p>To provide relevant data in the visualization interface the data of  subsystems "Data acquisition (DAQ)" must be used. The nature of these data as follows:
</p>
<ol><li> parameters that contain some number of attributes;</li>
<li> attributes of the parameter can provide information of four types: Boolean, Integer, Real and String;</li>
<li> attributes of the parameter can have their history (archive);</li>
<li> attributes of the parameter can be set to read, write, and with full access.</li></ol>
<p>Considering the first paragraph it is necessary to allow the possibility of the group of destination links. To do this we use the conception of <a href="../DAQ.html" title="Special:MyLanguage/Documents/DAQ">of the logic level</a>.
</p><p>In accordance with paragraph 2, links provide transparent conversion of connection types and do not require special configuration.
</p><p>To satisfy the opportunities for access to archives, in accordance with paragraph 3, links make check of the type of the attribute, and in the case of connection to the "Address", the address of linkage is put into the value.
</p><p>In terms of the VCA, the dynamic links and configuration of the dynamics are the one process, to describe a configuration of which the tab "Processing" of the widgets is provided (Fig.2.f). The tab contains a table of configuration of the properties of the attributes of the widget and the text of calculation procedure of  the widget.
</p><p>In addition to configuration fields of the attributes the column "Processing" in the table is provided, for selective using of the attributes of the widgets in the computational procedure of the widget, and the columns "Configuration" and "Configuration template", to describe the configuration of links.
</p><p>The column "Configuration" allows you to specify the linkage type for the attribute of the widget:
</p>
<ul><li> <i>Constant</i> — in the tab of widget links the field for indication of a constant appears, for example of the special color or header for the template frames.</li>
<li> <i>Input link</i> — linkage with the dynamics for a read-only.</li>
<li> <i>Output link</i> — linkage with the dynamics just for a writing.</li>
<li> <i>Full link</i> — complete linkage with dynamic (read/write).</li>
<li> <i>From style</i> — take the value from the project's style.</li></ul>
<p>The column "Configuration template" makes it possible to describe the groups of dynamic attributes. For example, it may be different types of parameters of subsystem "DAQ" and other widgets of the interface. Furthermore, in the case of correct formation of this field, the mechanism of automatically assign of the attributes with the only indication of the parameter of subsystem "DAQ" or the widget is working, which simplifies and accelerates the configuration process. The value of this column has the following format:
</p>
<ul><li> <i>For constant:</i> direct the attribute value.</li>
<li> <i>For link:</i> "<b>{parameter}|{identifier}</b>", where:
<ul><li> <i>parameter</i> — the group of the attribute;</li>
<li> <i>identifier</i> — identifier of the attribute; same the value is compared with the attributes of the DAQ parameters with automatic linkage, after the group link indication.</li></ul></li>
<li> <i>For style:</i> identifier-name of the style field.</li></ul>
<p>Installation of the links may be of several types, which are determined by the prefix:
</p>
<ul><li> <i>val:</i> — Direct download of the value through the links mechanism. For example, link: "val:100" loads in the attribute of the widget the value of the 100. It is often used in the case of absence of end point of the link, in order to direct value indicating.</li>
<li> <i>prm:</i> — Link to the attribute of the parameter or the parameter, in general, for a group of attributes, of subsystem "Data acquisition". For example, the link "prm:/LogicLev/experiment/Pi/var" implements the access of the attribute of the widget to the attribute of the parameter of subsystem "Data acquisition". Sign "(+)" at the end of the address indicate about successful linking and presence of the target. For object's type attributes allowed hierarchical access to the object concrete property by set the path through symbol '#', for example: "prm:/LogicLev/experiment/Pi/var#pr1/pr2".</li>
<li> <i>wdg:</i> — Link to an attribute of another widget or the widget, in general, for a group of attributes. For example, the link "wdg:/ses_AGLKS/pg_so/pg_1/pg_ggraph/pg_1/a_bordColor" performs the access of the attribute of one widget to the attribute of another one. Supported absolute and relative link's path. Start point of absolute point is root object of module "VCAEngine", then the first item of absolute address is a session or a project identifier. On session side first item is passed then set into a project links there work. For relative links by start point used a widget with the link set. The item ".." of parent node is a special item of the relative links.</li>
<li> <i>arh:</i> — A special type of link is only available for a particular attribute such as "Address", which allows you to connect directly to the archive values ("arh:CPU_load"). It may be useful to specify the archive as a source of data for primitive "Diagram".</li></ul>
<p>Processing of the links occurs at a frequency of calculating the widget in the following order:
</p>
<ul><li> receiving of the data from input links;</li>
<li> perform of calculating of the script;</li>
<li> transmission of the values by the output links.</li></ul>
<p>Figure 2.g presents the tab with the possibility of group and individual assignment of attributes.
</p><p>When the widget that contains the configuration of links is placed to the container of widgets, all links of the source widget is added to the list of resulting links of the widgets' container.
</p><p>The above shows that the links are set by the user in the configuration interface. However, for the possibility of creation of the frames for general use, with the function of providing detailed data of various sources of the same type, a dynamic linkage mechanism is necessary. Such mechanism is provided through a reserved key identifier "<b>&lt;page&gt;</b>" of the group of attributes of links in the frames of general purpose and dynamic linkage with the identifier "<b>&lt;page&gt;</b>" in the process of opening of the frame of general purpose by means of the signal from another widget.
</p><p>Lets examine the example when we have the frame of general-purpose "Control panel of graph" and a lot of "Graphs" in different tabs. "Control panel of graph" has links with the templates:
</p>
<ul><li> tSek -&gt; "&lt;page&gt;|tSek"</li>
<li> tSize -&gt; "&lt;page&gt;|tSize"</li>
<li> trcPer -&gt; "&lt;page&gt;|trcPer"</li>
<li> valArch -&gt; "&lt;page&gt;|valArch"</li></ul>
<p>At the same time, each widget "Graph" has the attributes tSek, tSize, trcPer and valArch. In the case of a calling of the opening signal of "Control panel of graph" from any widget "Graph" it is happening the linkage of the attributes of the "Control panel of graph" in accordance with the attribute specified in the template with the attribute of the widget "Graph". As a result, all changes in the "Control panel of graph" will be displayed on the graph by means of the link.
</p><p>In the case of presence of external links to the parameters of subsystem "Data acquisition" in the widget "Graph", the links of "Control panel of graph" will be set on an external source. In addition, if in the "Control panel of graph" will be declared the links to the missing attributes directly in the widget "Graph", it will be made the search for the availability of such attributes from the external source, the first to which the link is directed, performing, thus, the addition of missing links.
</p><p>To visualize this mechanism the table is cited.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Execution_of_the_VCA_interfaces"><span class="mw-headline-number">3</span> Execution of the VCA interfaces</span></h2>
<p>Execution of the VCA interface is to run a new project session or connect to the existing one on the level of VCA engine. Then the module of direct visualization represents and manages the data of the session. The main window mode of execution mode of this module has the form presented at Fig.3.
</p><p>Update of the contents of the open pages of the visualization interface with the frequency of the project session execution. In the updating process it is performed:
</p>
<ul><li> request a list of opened pages, with a sign of page modification, at the model and consistency checking of the actually opened pages to that list;</li>
<li> request of the branch of the modified pages;</li>
<li> update of the contents of the modified pages and their widgets, in accordance with the received modified data.</li></ul>
<p>At the closure of "Run-time" window closing of the session of the project is done in the VCA engine.
</p><p>The mechanism of the request of the only modified data is based on an absolute counter of the session execution. If you want to make real changes in the attributes of widgets the memorizing of the value of this counter is done, which allows the identification of modified attributes. This approach can increase productivity and reduce the load on network sharing in the case of access to the VCA engine via network.
</p><p>Hierarchically the module provides an opportunity to accommodate the project pages in the main execution window (Fig.3), as well as putting them inside of the container widgets, as well as by the opening of additional windows over the main.
</p><p>When you expand the main execution window, or when moving to the full-screen mode the scaling of the page content of the VCA interface is done, filling the entire space of the window and allowing to execute the projects, developed on one screen resolution, at different resolutions.
</p><p>The main window consists of menu (top) status line (bottom), and the executable contents of the session between them. Menu in the execution mode is positioned as the OpenSCADA administrator tool, containing the self-system functions and it is available only to privileged users, occupying the group "root". Menu has the following structure:
</p>
<ul><li> "File" — General operations.
<ul><li> "Print" — Print:
<ul><li> "Page" — page of the user interface;</li>
<li> "Diagram" — diagram on the user interface;</li>
<li> "Document" — document on the user interface.</li></ul></li>
<li> "Export" — Export:
<ul><li> "Page" — page of the user interface;</li>
<li> "Diagram" — diagram on the user interface;</li>
<li> "Document" — document on the user interface.</li></ul></li>
<li> "Close" — Close the editor window.</li>
<li> "Quit" — Quit from the OpenSCADA system.</li></ul></li>
<li> "Alarm" — Alarm quittance:
<ul><li> "Alarm level" — all alarms;</li>
<li> "Light alarm" — lighting notification;</li>
<li> "Speaker alarm" — notification with the whistle;</li>
<li> "Sound/speech alarm" — sound/speech notivication.</li></ul></li>
<li> "View" — Display options of the project session.
<ul><li> "Full screen" — Switcher of the full screen execution mode.</li></ul></li>
<li> "Help" — Help through the OpenSCADA and Vision module.
<ul><li> "About" — Information about this module.</li>
<li> "About Qt" — Information about the Qt library, used by the module.</li></ul></li>
<li> "QTStarter toolbar" — The toolbar, created by the module of the module of starting the Qt library modules. It contains buttons to start the UI modules of OpenSCADA, based on the Qt Library. With this toolbar you can open multiple copies of the windows of the module or other modules.</li></ul>
<p>On the right side of the status line the indicators of the time, the current VCA engine station and users on whose behalf the VCA interface is executed, as well as the panel with the alarm quittance buttons, print and export. By double-clicking on the indicator of the user it can be changed by the typing of the new username and password, and by clicking on the quittance button — to quit alarms completely or only the desired notification. In the main field of the status line various messages and assistance messages are displayed.
</p><p>The Run-time mode mostly supports multi-language depended from user language from which the window executed or selected, that is if you change the user you will get the Run-time interface at other language of the user.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Purpose_2"><span class="mw-headline-number">5.1</span> Purpose</span></h3>
<p>The presence of own vector graphics editor is an integral part of self-respecting SCADA system. Experience shows that the most informative form of technological process presentation is a mnemonic schemes — a set of alarm devices, images of the equipment, and internal connections of the controlled object, running on a PC (operator's station). To create them, you can use any of the existing graphical editors. However, thus obtained the mnemonic schemes are static and do not reflect the dynamics of changes in the characteristics of the process and, consequently, they are inadequate and uncomfortable for perception. Thus, one of the tasks facing the developers of SCADA systems is the creation of a graphical editor for creation (painting) the objects, whose characteristics can be dynamically changed.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Principles_and_functions_of_the_graphic_editor"><span class="mw-headline-number">5.2</span> Principles and functions of the graphic editor</span></h3>
<p>The basis of the described editor are three graphic primitives: line, arc, Bézier curve. The dynamically changing the characteristics of these primitives are:
</p>
<ul><li> Coordinates of control points; they are used to define the shape of the line, arc or Bézier curve. The line has two control points, the arc — 5 control points, Bézier curve — 4 (Fig. 5.2.a).</li>
<li> Line width.</li>
<li> Border width.</li>
<li> Border color.</li>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Basic_principles_of_operation_in_the_graphic_editor"><span class="mw-headline-number">5.3</span> Basic principles of operation in the graphic editor</span></h3>
<p>To get to work with a graphical editor after the OpenSCADA is started it is necessary to call "Operation user interface". The "Widgets" tab contains a list of existing graphic libraries and their elements.
</p><p>Lets suppose that we need to add a graphic element to the one of the existing libraries. To do this, select the name of the library, and click the (<a class="image" href="http://oscada.org/wiki/File:Vision_ElFigCreate.png"><img alt="Vision ElFigCreate.png" height="36" src="../files/Vision_ElFigCreate.png" width="32" /></a>) on the toolbar. In the appeared window enter the ID and name of the new graphic element. After that lets select the created item and click (<a class="image" href="http://oscada.org/wiki/File:Vision_ElFigEdit.png"><img alt="Vision ElFigEdit.png" height="23" src="../files/Vision_ElFigEdit.png" width="25" /></a>) button. The drawing area will appear on the right. By double-clicking on that field or either using the context menu lets enter the editing mode — the mode of the graphical editor that allows you to perform all provided manipulations with the figures. At a time when we have the created graphic element in focus, the "Attributes" tab takes the form, shown in Fig. 5.3.a.
</p>
<div class="center"><div class="thumb tnone"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:365px;"><a class="image" href="http://oscada.org/wiki/File:Vision_ElFigAttrs.png"><img class="thumbimage" height="441" src="../files/Vision_ElFigAttrs.png" width="363" /></a>  <div class="thumbcaption">Fig. 5.3.a. Attributes of elementary figure.</div></div></div></div>
<p>With the help of mouse or the "Geometry" field of the "Attributes" tab lets define the drawing area size and scale coefficients.
</p><p>Using the "Line" field of the "Attributes" tab, lets define the width, color, lines' style of the figures which we'll draw. With the "Border" field lets define the width and color of the border. The "Fill" field allows you to specify color, and image for the fills. "Elements' list" contains a list of primitives used to create the graphic object. Elements of all fields of the "Attributes" tab can be dynamically changed in the scripts (programs) of the user.
</p><p>Graphics primitives can be drawn with the mouse or by specifying the list of graphical primitives ("Elements' list"). In the first case, the coordinates of control points of the primitive are computed automatically, width, color, style of the line, width and color of the border are set by defaults from the "Attributes" tab. In the second case, the primitive must be described in the "Elements' list" as follows:
</p>
<dl><dd><i>line:(x1|y1):(x2|y2):width:color:border_width:border_color:style</i> <b>(1)</b></dd>
<dd><i>arc:(x1|y1):(x2|y2):(x3|y3):(x4|y4):(x5|y5):width:color:border_width:border_color:style</i> <b>(2)</b></dd>
<dd><i>bezier:(x1|y1):(x2|y2):(x3|y3):(x4|y4):width:color:border_width:border_color:style,</i> <b>(3)</b></dd></dl>
<p>Where:
</p>
<dl><dd><i>(x1|y1)</i> — first control point's coordinates of the primitive;</dd>
<dd><i>(x2|y2)</i> — second control point's coordinates of the primitive;</dd>
<dd><i>(x3|y3)</i> — third control point's coordinates of the primitive;</dd>
<dd><i>(x4|y4)</i> — fourth control point's coordinates of the primitive;</dd>
<dd><i>(x5|y5)</i> — fifth control point's coordinates of the primitive;</dd>
<dd><i>width</i> — line width, with which the primitive will be drawn;</dd>
<dd><i>color</i> — line color, with which the primitive will be drawn;</dd>
<dd><i>border_width</i> — border width;</dd>
<dd><i>border_color</i> — border color;</dd>
<dd><i>style</i> — line style ("0" — solid, "1" — dashed, "2" — dotted).</dd></dl>
<p>The priority values are the width, color, style of the line, width and color of the border, specified in the "Elements' list". If you want to use any of the properties that are set in the fields "Line" or "Border" of the "Attributes" tab, then during the description of the primitive they should be skipped. For example, we want to create a line with a width of 3, red color, solid and without border. At the same time in the "Line" field the following properties are set: the line width — 3, black color of the line, solid line style, and in the "Border" field — the width of the border — 5, border's color — green. Then the description of the primitive in the "Elements' list " will be as follows:
</p>
<dl><dd><i>line:(x1|y1):(x2|y2)::red:0::</i> <b>(4)</b></dd></dl>
<p>Expressions (1) - (4) define the static properties of the primitives that can not be changed by user's program. To specify the dynamic properties it is necessary to use the following expression:
</p>
<dl><dd><i>line:1:2:w1:c1:w2:c2:s1</i> <b>(5)</b></dd></dl>
<p>Then the "Attributes" tab will be appended by the fields: Point 1 (<i>1</i>), Point 2 (<i>2</i>), Width 1(<i>w1</i>), Width 2(<i>w2</i>), Color 1(<i>c1</i>), Color 2(<i>c2</i>), Style 1 (<i>s1</i>) (Fig. 5.3.b), values of these fields can be changed programmatically, by using a programming language of the OpenSCADA project. It is obvious that if desired not all properties of the primitive can be declared dynamic, but one or several, besides one dynamic property can be used repeatedly.
</p><p>Editing the coordinates of control points is made either with the mouse or through changes in the "Elements' list " for static points, or directly in the "Attributes" tab, having the dynamic ones ("Point 1"...). Editing the other properties is made by means of changing the contents of the fields "Line", "Border", "Fill" of the "Attributes" tab or the "Elements' list".

Dynamic attributes of the elementary figure.</div></div></div></div>
<p>There is the possibility of selection (left click on the figure) the primitive, the joint selection of primitives (left mouse button + "Ctrl" key pressed having disabled the "Connections" button), a joint selection by the frame, drawn by holding down the left mouse button; moving them (keyboard/mouse); copy and paste ("Ctrl" + "C", "Ctrl" + "V" or from the popup menu); delete ("Del").
</p><p>To connect the primitives with each other it is necessary:
</p>
<ol><li> push the "Connections" button;</li>
<li> select one of the figures and move its start or end point to the desired start or end point of the other figure so that it will get to the appeared circle. Connected figures are moving as well as the individual ones, the general point is moved for all connected figures, to which it refers(priority is given to the arc, two arcs can't be connected directly with each other ).</li>
<li> release the left mouse button.</li></ol>
<p>To fill the closed circuit it is necessary to make double click of the left mouse button inside it or you can specify a fill in the "Elements' list" as follows:
</p>
<dl><dd><i>fill:(x1:y1):(x2:y2):...:(xn:yn):color:image</i> — (statics);</dd>
<dd><i>fill:1:2:3:...:c1:i1</i> — (dynamics).</dd></dl>
<p>Where:
</p>
<dl><dd><i>(x1:y1):(x2:y2):...:(xn:yn)</i> — coordinates of the start/end points of the primitives that form a closed circuit;</dd>
<dd><i>color</i> — fill color;</dd>
<dd><i>image</i> — fill image.</dd></dl>
<p>The priority values are the color and image of the fill, set in the "Elements' list. " If you want to use the properties set in the "Fill" field of the "Attributes" tab, then they should be skipped in the description of the primitive.
</p><p>To scale the figures it is necessary in the "Geometry" field to set the scale the for the "X" and "Y" axes. In addition, there is the ability to visually zoom in/out the widget without changing the scale in the "Geometry" field. You must exit the editing mode by the right click on the widget field, select in the popup menu "Zoom in (+10%)"/"Zoom out (-10%)", or rotate the mouse wheel while holding the "Ctrl" key pressed. Exit the editing mode is made either by pressing the "Esc", or using the popup menu of the widget.
</p><p>It is possible to rotate the contents of the widget. To rotate the created objects you should set the "Orientation angle" from -360 to 360 in the "Attributes" tab.
</p><p>Graphical editor supports color transparency, defined as follows: color-t, where the color — the color itself, and t — transparency from 0 (fully transparent) to 255 (opaque).

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Popup_menu_of_the_graphic_editor"><span class="mw-headline-number">5.4</span> Popup menu of the graphic editor</span></h3>
<p>The popup menu by the right-clicking in the editable widget is provided. Depending on what an object is under the mouse popup menu can take several different forms. Below, in Figure 5.4, there are examples of the popup menu.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Properties_dialog_of_the_elementary_figure"><span class="mw-headline-number">5.5</span> Properties dialog of the elementary figure</span></h3>
<p>Dialog, versions of which are shown in Figures 5.5.a, 5.5.b, 5.5.c, is implemented for interactive and comfortable user control of the properties of the figure(s).
</p>
<div class="center"><div class="thumb tnone"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:698px;"><a class="image" href="http://oscada.org/wiki/File:Vision_ElFigDlgLine.png"><img class="thumbimage" height="326" src="../files/Vision_ElFigDlgLine.png" width="696" /></a>  <div class="thumbcaption">Fig. 5.5.a.

<p>As can be seen from the figures above, the dialog can be of three different forms, depending on the object for which it is called. In the title of the dialog there are the numbers of figures, for which it is called. These numbers correspond to the positions of figures in the "Elements' list", starting from the top.
</p><p>If the dialog called for a single figure (line, arc or a Bézier curve), then it is possible to edit the points' coordinates of the figure (Fig. 5.5.a). If the point is connected to the point of another figure or figures, and "bindings" ("Connections") are enabled, then entered coordinates will be applied to all connected figures and fills, which involved the figure, will be redrawn accordingly.
</p><p>If the dialog is called for the group of selected figures (Fig. 5.5.b), properties (attributes) listed in the dialog will be applied to all figures listed in the title of the dialog. When you call the dialog in the fields of the properties will be shown the data of the figure from the group of selected ones, for which it was called the popup menu. There is the possibility to include/exclude certain properties of the dialog. For this the (<a class="image" href="http://oscada.org/wiki/File:Vision_disableButton.png"><img alt="Vision disableButton.png" height="28" src="../files/Vision_disableButton.png" width="32" /></a>) button is provided. In the case of exclusion of individual properties, they will not be processed upon acceptation of the dialog ("Ok" button). After the acceptation of the dialog, all of the data of the included properties will be applied to the whole group of figures.
</p><p>Dialog for the fill's properties (Fig. 5.5.c) allows you to manage the properties of the specific fill.
</p><p>When selecting a check box to the right of a property, it (the property) after the acceptation of the dialog is set to the default value, which is listed in the "Attributes" tab. The "Dyn/Stat" buttons make the appropriate properties dynamic or static.

<p>To adjust your own behavior in not obvious situations the module provides the ability to customize individual settings through the management interface of the OpenSCADA (Fig. 6). These settings are:
</p>
<ul><li> Module Status: running, the number of available screens in the library of Qt and active main widows list.</li>
<li> The name of the remote OpenSCADA station with visualization engine VCA and the link to the configuration page of the external OpenSCADA stations.</li>
<li> Initial user of the configurator — points on behalf of what user to open configurator without requiring the password, for local station. For remote station it is points to an user different from typical one, pointed into the host configuration.</li>
<li> User password (remote station) — password of user different from typical one, pointed into the host configuration.</li>
<li> Restore connection timeout, in seconds — points to time of the re-connection of a lost remote connection repeating.</li>
<li> The lifetime of the pages in the cache. Visualizer provides acceleration of the user interface by placing a previously opened pages in the cache, to control the lifespan of pages in which the property and intended. Specifying a value of zero generally excludes cleaning the cache.</li>
<li> The projects, by separate symbol ';', for their automatic execution with the launch of the module. To provide the possibility to indicate the opening of the window of the project execution on the desired display of many display systems the recording format of the project "PrjName-1" is provided, where 1 — the number of the target display. For connect to background or other opened session use "<b>ses_{SesID}</b>".</li></ul>
<dl><dd><a class="image" href="http://oscada.org/wiki/File:At.png"><img alt="At.png" height="22" src="../files/At.png" width="22" /></a> The display selection function possible for non virtual and non repeating desktop, i.e. with using Xinerma or NVidia into proper modes. Technical the function Qt screen() must return different display's widgets to it's number.</dd></dl>
<ul><li> Exit on last run project close — useful for solutions running at once on the interface of the project execution.</li></ul>
