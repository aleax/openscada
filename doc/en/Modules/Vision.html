<p>The module provides to OpenSCADA a mechanism of the final visualization of the visualization and control area (VCA). The module is based on the multi-platform library <a class="external text" href="http://qt.io" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Qt</a> of the graphical user interface (GUI) of initially created by the firm <a class="external text" href="http://www.trolltech.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">TrollTech</a>. In its work, the module uses the data of the VCA engine — module <a href="../Modules/VCAEngine.html" title="Special:MyLanguage/Modules/VCAEngine">VCAEngine</a>).
</p><p>Visual control area (VCA) is an integral part of the SCADA system. It applies to the client stations with a view to providing accessible information about the control object and to for the the issuance of the control actions to the object. In various practical situations and conditions the VCA, based on different principles of visualization, may by applied. For example, this may be the library of widgets Qt, GTK+, WxWidgets or hypertext mechanisms based on the technologies HTML, XHTML, XML, CSS and JavaScript, or third-party applications of visualization, realized in various programming languages Java, Python, etc. Any of these principles has its advantages and disadvantages, the combination of which could become an insurmountable obstacle to the use of VCA in a practical case. For example, technologies like the Qt library can create highly-productive VCA, which will undoubtedly important for the operator station for control the technological processes (TP). However, the need for installation of that client software in some cases may make using of it impossible. On the other hand, Web-technology does not require installation on client systems and is extremely multi-platform (it is enough to create a link to the Web-server at any Web-browser) that is most important for various engineering and administrative stations, but the productivity and reliability of such interfaces is lower, that actually eliminates the using of them at the operator stations of TP.
</p><p>OpenSCADA has extremely flexible architecture that allows you to create external interfaces, including user, in any manner and taste. For example, the OpenSCADA configuration environment available now as by means of the Qt-library, and also the Web-based.
</p><p>At the same time, independent creation of the VCA implementations in different basis may cause the inability to use the configuration of one VCA into another one. That is inconvenient and limited from the user side, as well as costly in terms of implementation and follow-up support.
</p><p>In order to avoid these problems, as well as to create as soon as possible the full spectrum of different types of VCA, 
<a class="external" href="http://oscada.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Sub-projects/VCA" title="Special:MyLanguage/Sub-projects/VCA">the project of conception of the Visual Control Area (VCA)</a> is established. The result of this project — this direct visualization module (based on the library Qt), direct visualization module <a href="../Modules/WebVision.html" title="Special:MyLanguage/Modules/WebVision">WebVision</a> and the VCA engine <a href="../Modules/VCAEngine.html" title="Special:MyLanguage/Modules/VCAEngine">VCAEngine</a>.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Purpose"><span class="mw-headline-number">1</span> Purpose</span></h2>
<p>This module of the direct visualization of the VCA is designed for the formation and execution of VCA interfaces among the graphic library Qt. The VCA module mostly provides:
</p>
<ul><li> three levels of difficulty in the formation of the visualization interface, which allow organically to develop and apply the tools by the principle — from simple to complex:</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ol><li> formation from the template frames, by assigning the dynamics and without the graphical configuration;</li>
<li> graphical formation of new frames, using ready-made visualization elements from the library - mnemosmes;</li>
<li> forming, in the library, new ones: frames, template frames and display elements.</li></ol></dd></dl>
<ul><li> construction of interfaces for visualization of practically any complexity (limited by the "discreteness" of the primitive functions), ranging from simple monitoring interfaces, and to complete hierarchical interfaces used in SCADA systems;</li>
<li> providing the different ways of forming and configuration of the user interface, based on different interfaces of graphical representation (Qt, Web, ...), or-through the standard interface of OpenSCADA control;</li>
<li> construction and correction of the interface, appointment and change of the dynamics in the process of the execution;</li>
<li> construction, at the user level, of new template frames and the formation of specialized ones, under the scope, libraries of frames (e.g. the inclusion of parameters frames, diagrams and other elements linking them to each other), according to the idea of secondary use, accumulation and improvement;</li>
<li> construction of new custom visualization elements and the formation of specialized, at the field of application, libraries of frames, according to the idea of secondary use, accumulation and improvement;</li>
<li> description of the logic of new template frames and user visualization elements as by the simple links as well by the compact and full-featured user programming language;</li>
<li> possibility of inclusion, to the user's visualization elements, the functions (or frames of functions' calculation) of the object model of OpenSCADA, practically linking the presentation with the algorithm of computation, for example, visualizing the library of the apparatus of TP models for subsequent visual building of the TP models;</li>
<li> separation the data of the user interfaces and presentation interfaces of these data, allowing to build the user interface in the one environment, and execute in many others (Qt, Web, ...);</li>
<li> ability to connect to the executable interface for monitoring and correction of actions; for example, training operators and monitoring their actions in real time;</li>
<li> visual construction of various schemes with overlapping logical connections and subsequent centralized execution in the background - visual construction and execution of mathematical models, logic circuits, relay circuits and other;</li>
<li> providing, to OpenSCADA, object API functions; can be used to control the properties of the visualization interface from user procedures;</li>
<li> server construction for: frames, visualization elements and visualization interface projects; with the ability to service multiple client connections;</li>
<li> simple organization of client stations on different bases (Qt, Web, ...) with the connection to the central server;</li>
<li> full-featured mechanism for distributing authorities between users that allows you to create and execute projects with different rights to access their components;</li>
<li> flexible formation of rules of alarms and notifications, with the support of various methods of the notification;</li>
<li> support of custom formation of the palette and font preferences for the visualization interface, in styles;</li>
<li> support of the user forming of the events maps under various control equipment and user's preferences;</li>
<li> support for user profiles, allowing the identification of various properties of the visualization interface (colors, font features, the preferred card of events);</li>
<li> flexible storage and distribution of libraries of widgets, frames and projects of the visualization interfaces in the databases, supported by OpenSCADA; practically, the user only has to register the received database with the data.</li></ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Tool_of_the_graphical_formation_of_the_VCA_interface"><span class="mw-headline-number">2</span> Tool of the graphical formation of the VCA interface</span></h2>
<p>Development of the VCA interface is performed in a single window, realizing many documents interface (MDI) (Fig.2.a). This approach allows you to simultaneously open multiple frames of various sizes. The following mechanisms to control the development are used: toolbars, menus and context menus. Most actions are duplicated by different mechanisms, that allows you to quickly find the tool by the convenient method. Navigational interfaces are implemented by the attached windows. Configuration of the toolbars and attached windows is saved on exit and restored at startup that lets you to customize the interface for yourself.

<p>It knows that people can have individual features in the perception of graphical information. If these features are not taken into account, it is possible to obtain the rejection and abruption of the user to the interface of VC. This rejection and abruption can lead to fatal errors in the management of TP, as well as traumatize the human by the continuous work with the interface. In SCADA systems, arrangements have been made that regulate the requirements for creating the unified UI interface, which is normally perceived by most people. This is practically eliminates the features of people with some deviations.
</p><p>In order to take this into account and allow centralized and easy to change the visual properties of the interface module is implementing a theme manager of the visualization interface.
</p><p>User can create many themes, each of which will keep the color, font and other properties of the frame elements. Simple changing of the theme will allow you to change the interface of VC, and the possibility of appointing an individual theme in the user's profile allows to take into account his individual features.
</p><p>To realize this opportunity, when creating a frame, it is necessary for the properties of color, font and others set the "Configuration" (of the table in the "Process" tab) in the value of "From style". And in the parameter "Configuration template" to specify the identifier of the style field. Next, this field will automatically appear in the style manager and can be modified there. The style manager is available on the project configuration page in the tab "Styles". In this tab, you can the styles create, delete and edit, delete their fields.
</p>
<div class="center"><div class="floatnone"><a class="image" href="http://oscada.org/wiki/File:Vision_prj_stl.png"><img alt="Vision prj stl.png" height="334" src="../files/Vision_prj_stl.png" width="398" /></a></div></div>
<p>In general, the styles are available from the project level. At the level of the widget libraries you can only define the style fields for the widgets. At the project level, at the choice of style, it is started the work with styles, which includes access to the fields of styles instead of direct attribute values. In fact, this means that when reading or writing a widget attribute these operations will be carried out with the corresponding field of the chosen style.
</p><p>When starting a project, the project-style will be used. In the future, the user can choose a style from the list of available. The user-selected style will be saved and used the next time the project is launched.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Linkage_with_the_dynamics"><span class="mw-headline-number">2.2</span> Linkage with the dynamics</span></h3>
<p>To provide the visualization interface of relevant data, data from the subsystem "Data acquisition (DAQ)" should be used. The nature of these data is as follows:
</p>
<ol><li> parameters that contain some number of attributes;</li>
<li> attributes of the parameter can provide information of five types: Boolean, Integer, Real, String and Object;</li>
<li> attributes of the parameter can have their archive (history);</li>
<li> attributes of the parameter can be set to read, write and with full access.</li></ol>
<p>Given the first point, it is necessary to provide the possibility of group-based reference. To do this, we use <a href="../DAQ.html#LogicLev" title="Special:MyLanguage/Documents/DAQ">the logical level concept</a>.
</p><p>The links provide a transparent type conversion and do not require a special configuration.
</p><p>To satisfy the opportunities for accessing to archives links make check of the attribute type, and in the case of connection to the "Address", the address of the link is put into the value.
</p><p>In the VCA terms, the dynamic links and configuration of the dynamics are the one process, to describe a configuration of which the tab "Processing" of the widgets is provided (Fig.2.f). The tab contains a table of configuration of the attributes properties and the calculation procedure text of the widget.
</p><p>In addition to configuration fields of the attributes the column "Processing" in the table provides, for selective using of the attributes in the computational procedure of the widget, and the columns "Configuration", "Configuration template", to describe the links configuration.
</p><p>The column "Configuration" allows to specify the link type of the widget attribute:
</p>
<ul><li> <i>Constant</i> — in the tab of widget links the field for indication of a constant appears, for example, of the special color or header of the template frames.</li>
<li> <i>Input link</i> — linkage with the dynamics for read-only.</li>
<li> <i>Output link</i> — linkage with the dynamics just for writing.</li>
<li> <i>Full link</i> — complete linkage with dynamic, read/write.</li>
<li> <i>From style</i> — take the value from the project's style.</li></ul>
<p>The column "Configuration template" makes it possible to describe the groups of dynamic attributes. For example, it may be different types of parameters of the subsystem "DAQ" and other interface widgets. With the correct formation of this field, the mechanism of automatic assignment of attributes is worked, with only the parameter of the subsystem "DAQ" or the widget of the interface, which simplifies and accelerates the configuration process. Value of this column has the following format:
</p>
<ul><li> <i>For constant:</i> direct the attribute value.</li>
<li> <i>For link:</i> "<b>{parameter}|{identifier}</b>", where:
<ul><li> <i>parameter</i> — group of the attribute;</li>
<li> <i>identifier</i> — identifier of the attribute; same the value is compared with the attributes of the DAQ parameters with automatic linkage, after the group link indication.</li></ul></li>
<li> <i>For style:</i> identifier-name of the style field.</li></ul>
<p>There may be several types of links, that are defined by the prefix:
</p>
<ul><li> <i>val:</i> — Direct download value through the link mechanism. For example, the "val:100" link loads value 100 to the widget attribute. Often used in the absence of a terminal point of linking, for the purpose of directly setting the value.</li>
<li> <i>prm:</i> — Link to the parameter attribute or parameter, in general, for the attributes group of the "Data acquisition" subsystem. For example, the link "prm:/LogicLev/experiment/Pi/var" performs the access of the widget attribute to the parameter attribute of the subsystem "Data acquisition". Sign "(+)" at the end of the address indicate about successful linking and presence of the target. For object-type attributes, permissible hierarchical access to a specific property of the object, by specifying its path through the symbol '#', for example: "prm:/LogicLev/experiment/Pi/var#pr1/pr2".</li>
<li> <i>wdg:</i> — Link to the attribute of another widget or widget, in general, for the attributes group. For example, the link "wdg:/ses_AGLKS/pg_so/pg_1/pg_ggraph/pg_1/a_bordColor" performs the access of the attribute of one widget to the attribute of another one. Supported both absolute and relative paths of the links. The reference point of the address of the absolute link is the root object of the module "VCAEngine", which means — the first element of the absolute address is ID of the session or project. The first element, on the side of the session, drops, so the links, installed in the project, work there. Relative links take a countdown from the widget where the link is specified. A special element of relative link is an element of a higher node "..".</li>
<li> <i>arh:</i> — A special type of the link, available only for a separate attribute of the type "Address", which allows you to connect directly to the value archive ("arh:CPU_load"). It may be useful to specify the archive as a data source for the primitive "Diagram".</li></ul>
<p>Processing of the links occurs at a period of the widget calculating in the following order:
</p>
<ul><li> receiving the data from the input links;</li>
<li> performing the calculation of the widget procedure;</li>
<li> transmission the values by the output links.</li></ul>
<p>Figure 2.g presents the tab with the possibility of group and individual assignment of attributes.
</p><p>When placing a widget in the widget container, all links of the original widget are added to the list of resulting links of the widget container, however, only to a depth at one level of nesting.
</p><p>From the foregoing it is clear that the links are set by the user during the configuration of the interface. However, in order to allow the creation of general-purpose frames with the function of providing detailed data of different sources of the same type, a <span id="DynLink" title="#DynLink">dynamic linking mechanism</span> is required. Such a mechanism is foreseen:
</p>
<ul><li> reserving the key identifier "<b>&lt;page&gt;</b>" for the group of attributes of links in general purpose frames;</li>
<li> dynamically assigning links to the identifier "<b>&lt;page&gt;</b>" in the process of opening a general-purpose frame by the signal from another widget.</li></ul>
<p>Let's examine the example when we have the frame of general-purpose "Control panel of graph" and a lot of "Graphs" in different frames. "Control panel of graph" has links with the templates:
</p>
<ul><li> tSek -&gt; "&lt;page&gt;|tSek"</li>
<li> tSize -&gt; "&lt;page&gt;|tSize"</li>
<li> trcPer -&gt; "&lt;page&gt;|trcPer"</li>
<li> valArch -&gt; "&lt;page&gt;|valArch"</li></ul>
<p>In this case, each widget "Graph" has attributes "tSek", "tSize", "trcPer" and "valArch". Calling the "Control panel of graph" by opening signal from any widget "Graph", the attributes of the "Control panel of graph" are linked together with the attributes of the "Graph" widget, according to the template. As a result, all changes in the "Control panel of graph" will be displayed on the graph, through these links.
</p><p>If the "Graph" widget has external links to the parameters of the "Data acquisition" subsystem, the "Control panel of graph" links will be installed on the external source. Additionally, if the "Control panel of graph" will be declared the links to the missing attributes directly in the widget "Graph", then the search will be made for the presence of such attributes in the external source — the first one on which a direct link is established, performing, thereby, the addition of the missing links.
</p><p>To visualize this mechanism the table is provided.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Execution_of_the_VCA_interfaces"><span class="mw-headline-number">3</span> <span id="RunTime" title="#RunTime">Execution of the VCA interfaces</span></span></h2>
<p>Execution of the IU interface consists in launching a new project session or connecting to the current one, at the level of the VCA engine. Then the module of direct visualization represents and controls the session data. The main window of the execution mode of this module has the view presented at Figure 3.
</p><p>Update of the contents of the open pages of the visual interface with periodicity of the project session is implemented. During the upgrade process:
</p>
<dl><dd>- request, in the model, of opened pages list and checking consistency of the really opened pages to this list;</dd>
<dd>- requests of modified data on each opened page and its widgets;</dd>
<dd>- updating content of the pages and their widgets in accordance with the received modified data.</dd></dl>
<p>When closing the "Runtime" window closes the project session in the data model if the session is not background and it was the last connection.
</p><p>The mechanism of the request for only modified data is based on the absolute counter of the session execution. When you make real changes in the attributes of widgets the remembering of the value of this counter is made, which allows us to identify the modified attributes. This approach allows to increase productivity and reduce the load on the traffic in case of access to the model through the network.
</p><p>Hierarchically, the module assumes the possibility of placing pages of the project as in the main window of execution (Fig. 3), and by placing inside the container widgets, as well as by opening additional windows over the main one.
</p><p>When you expand the main execution window, or moving to the full-screen mode, scaling of the page content of the VCA interface is performed, filling the entire space of the window and allowing to execute the projects, developed on one screen resolution, at different resolutions.
</p><p>The main window consists of menu (top) status line (bottom), and the executable contents of the session between them. Menu in the execution mode is positioned as the administrator tool of OpenSCADA, which contains system-wide functions, and is only available to privileged users in the "root" group. Menu has the following structure:
</p>
<ul><li> "File" — General operations.
<ul><li> "Print" — print:
<ul><li> "Page" — page of the user interface;</li>
<li> "Diagram" — diagram on the user interface;</li>
<li> "Document" — document on the user interface.</li></ul></li>
<li> "Export" — export:
<ul><li> "Page" — page of the user interface, to image;</li>
<li> "Diagram" — diagram on the user interface, to image and CSV;</li>
<li> "Document" — document on the user interface, to HTML and CSV for exporting tables.</li></ul></li>
<li> "Close" — close the editor window.</li>
<li> "Quit" — quit the program.</li></ul></li>
<li> "Alarm" — Alarm quietance:
<ul><li> "Alarm level" — all alarms;</li>
<li> "Light" — notification with the lighting;</li>
<li> "Buzzer" — notification with the buzzing;</li>
<li> "Sound/speech" — notification with the sound/speech.</li></ul></li>
<li> "View" — Display options of the project session.
<ul><li> "Full screen" — switcher of the full screen execution mode.</li></ul></li>
<li> "Help" — Help through the VCA project, this module and OpenSCADA.
<ul><li> "About" — information about this module.</li>
<li> "About Qt" — Information about the Qt library, used by this module.</li>
<li> "Manual on the project '{Name}'" — call the manual on the project of the visualization — a file with the name of the VCA project identifier.</li>
<li> "Manual on 'Vision'" — call the manual on this module.</li>
<li> "Manual on 'OpenSCADA 0.9.0'" — call the manual on OpenSCADA in whole.</li></ul></li>
<li> "QTStarter" — Menu item, created by the module for running the Qt library modules. Contains start buttons for UI modules OpenSCADA, based on the Qt library. This option allows you to open several instances of the windows of this module or other modules. In the case of the execution mode, this menu allows you to open the development window from the executing one, re-calling the module.</li></ul>
<p>On the status line locates:
</p>
<ul><li> On the right side:
<ul><li> the clock, in the full-screen mode;</li>
<li> the current VCA engine station;</li>
<li> the current user, on whose behalf the VCA interface is executed — by a double-clicking this user can be changed, typing of the new username and password;</li>
<li> the current interface style, which can be changed by a double-clicking.</li>
<li> the panel with buttons:
<ul><li> alarms quietance — by a click the violations can be quieted completely or just the desired type of the notification;</li>
<li> export and print — calls by a click for the dialog of exporting and printing the default element or selected from the menu, where the export for:
<ul><li> "Page" — page of the user interface, to image;</li>
<li> "Diagram" — diagram on the user interface, to image and CSV;</li>
<li> "Document" — document on the user interface, to HTML and CSV for exporting tables.</li></ul></li>
<li> manual on the VCA project — calls by a click the manual on the visualization project — a file with the name of the identifier of the VCA project.</li></ul></li>
<li> the panel of user actions, if specified in <a href="#SpecAttrs">the attribute "statLine"</a> — by clicking the left, right and double click forms the even to the main interface page.</li></ul></li>
<li> In the main field of the status line various messages and assistance messages are displayed.</li></ul>
<p>The Runtime mode mostly supports multi-language, which depends on the language of the selected user or the execution window, that is if you change the user you will get the Runtime interface at other language of the user.

<li> <i>Page</i> — Elements, constructed on the basis of the primitive, may serve as a page of the user interface.</li>
<li> <i>Container of pages</i> — Property of substitution, in the execution process, of its own content by another page. Used to create frames on the pages of the user interface. For example, the main page of the typical SCADA-system with signal objects is constructed in this way.</li>
<li> <i>Background</i> — Supports for ability to specify the background as color and image.</li>
<li> <i>Border</i> — Supports for displaying of the border with the specified color, width and style.</li></ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Vector_graphics_editor"><span class="mw-headline-number">5</span> <span id="ElFigure" title="#ElFigure">Vector graphics editor</span></span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Purpose_2"><span class="mw-headline-number">5.1</span> Purpose</span></h3>
<p>The presence of own vector graphics editor is an integral part of self-respecting SCADA system. Experience shows that the most informative form of the technological process presentation is a mnemonic schemes — a set of signal devices, images of the equipment and internal connections of the controlled object, running on a PC. To create them, you can use any of the existing graphical editors. However, thus obtained the mnemonic schemes are static and do not reflect the dynamics of changes in the characteristics of the process and, consequently, they are inadequate and uncomfortable for perception. Thus, one of the tasks facing the developers of SCADA systems is the creation of a graphical editor for creation (painting) the objects, whose characteristics can be dynamically changed.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Principles_and_functions_of_the_graphic_editor"><span class="mw-headline-number">5.2</span> Principles and functions of the graphic editor</span></h3>
<p>The basis of the described editor are three graphic primitives: line, arc, Bézier curve. The dynamically changing characteristics of these primitives include:
</p>
<ul><li> Coordinates of the control points used to define the shape of the line, arc or Bézier curve. The line has 2 control points, the arc — 5, Bézier curve — 4 (Fig.5.2.a).</li>
<li> Line width.</li>
<li> Border width.</li>
<li> Border color.</li>
<li> Line style.</li></ul>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Basic_principles_of_operation_in_the_graphical_editor"><span class="mw-headline-number">5.3</span> Basic principles of operation in the graphical editor</span></h3>
<p>In order to get started with the graphical editor, after launching the OpenSCADA project, you need to call "Operation user interface (Qt)". The "Widgets" tab contains a list of existing graphical libraries and items that belong to them.
</p><p>Suppose we need to add a graphic element to one of the existing libraries. To do this, select the library name, and click the button (<a class="image" href="http://oscada.org/wiki/File:Vision_ElFigCreate.png"><img alt="Vision ElFigCreate.png" height="36" src="../files/Vision_ElFigCreate.png" width="32" /></a>) on the toolbar. In the appeared window enter the Identifier and name of the new graphic element. After that, let's move on to this element and press the button (<a class="image" href="http://oscada.org/wiki/File:Vision_ElFigEdit.png"><img alt="Vision ElFigEdit.png" height="23" src="../files/Vision_ElFigEdit.png" width="25" /></a>). The drawing area will appear on the right. Using the double-click mouse over this field, or by using the context menu, we will enter the editing mode — the graphic editor mode, which allows you to perform all the provided manipulations with the figures. At that moment, when the graphic element we created is in focus, the tab "Attributes" will look like it is shown in Figure 5.3.a.
</p>
<div class="center"><div class="thumb tnone"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:365px;"><a class="image" href="http://oscada.org/wiki/File:Vision_ElFigAttrs.png"><img class="thumbimage" height="461" src="../files/Vision_ElFigAttrs.png" width="363" /></a>  <div class="thumbcaption">Fig.5.3.a. Attributes of the elementary figure.</div></div></div></div>
<p>With the help of mouse, or the "Geometry" field of the "Attributes" tab, let's define the drawing area size and scale coefficients.
</p><p>Using the "Line" field of the "Attributes" tab, lets define the width, color, line style of the figures, which we'll draw. With the "Border" field let's define the width and color of the border. The "Fill" field allows you to specify color, and image for the fills. "Elements list" contains a list of primitives used to create the graphical object. Elements of all fields of the "Attributes" tab can be dynamically changed in the user procedure.
</p><p>Graphical primitives can be drawn with the mouse or by specifying the list of graphical primitives ("Elements list"). In the first case, the coordinates of the control points of the primitive are computed automatically, and width, color, style of the line, width and color of the border are set by defaults, from the "Attributes" tab. In the second case, the primitive must be described in the "Elements list" as follows:
</p>
<dl><dd><i>line:(x1|y1):(x2|y2):width:color:border_width:border_color:style</i> <b>(1)</b></dd>
<dd><i>arc:(x1|y1):(x2|y2):(x3|y3):(x4|y4):(x5|y5):width:color:border_width:border_color:style</i> <b>(2)</b></dd>
<dd><i>bezier:(x1|y1):(x2|y2):(x3|y3):(x4|y4):width:color:border_width:border_color:style,</i> <b>(3)</b></dd></dl>
<p>Where:
</p>
<dl><dd><i>(x1|y1)</i> — coordinates of the first control point of the primitive;</dd>
<dd><i>(x2|y2)</i> — coordinates of the second control point of the primitive;</dd>
<dd><i>(x3|y3)</i> — coordinates of the third control point of the primitive;</dd>
<dd><i>(x4|y4)</i> — coordinates of the fourth control point of the primitive;</dd>
<dd><i>(x5|y5)</i> — coordinates of the fifth control point of the primitive;</dd>
<dd><i>width</i> — line width, with which the primitive will be drawn;</dd>
<dd><i>color</i> — line color, with which the primitive will be drawn;</dd>
<dd><i>border_width</i> — border width;</dd>
<dd><i>border_color</i> — border color;</dd>
<dd><i>style</i> — line style ("0" — solid, "1" — dashed, "2" — dotted).</dd></dl>
<p>In this case, the values of the width, color, style of the line, width, and color of the border in the elements list are priority. If you want to use any of the properties, that are set in the fields "Line" or "Border" of the "Attributes" tab, then during the description of the primitive they should be skipped. For example, we want to create a line with: width 3, red color, solid and without border. At the same time in the "Line" field the following properties are set: line width 3, black color and solid style; and in the "Border" field: border width 5, green color. Then the description of the primitive in the elements list will be as follows:
</p>
<dl><dd><i>line:(x1|y1):(x2|y2)::red:0::</i> <b>(4)</b></dd></dl>
<p>Expressions (1) - (4) define the static properties of the primitives that can not be changed in user's procedure. To specify the dynamic properties it is necessary to use the following expression:
</p>
<dl><dd><i>line:1:2:w1:c1:w2:c2:s1</i> <b>(5)</b></dd></dl>
<p>Then, the "Attributes" tab will be appended by the fields: Point 1 (<i>1</i>), Point 2 (<i>2</i>), Width 1(<i>w1</i>), Width 2(<i>w2</i>), Color 1(<i>c1</i>), Color 2(<i>c2</i>), Style 1 (<i>s1</i>) (Fig. 5.3.b). Values of these fields can be changed in user's procedure, using the user programming language of OpenSCADA. Obviously, if desired, not all properties of the primitive can be declared dynamic, but one or more, in addition, one dynamic property can be used repeatedly.
</p><p>Editing the coordinates of the control points is made using the mouse or by changing them in the elements list, for static points; or directly in the "Attributes" tab, with dynamic points in place ("Point 1", ...). Editing the other properties is made by means of changing the content of the fields "Line", "Border", "Fill" of the "Attributes" tab or the elements list.

<p>There are possibilities:
</p>
<ul><li> selection:
<ul><li> left mouse click on the figure;</li>
<li> joint selection of the primitives — left mouse button + the "Ctrl" key pressed, having disabled the "Connections" button;</li>
<li> joint selection by the frame, drawn by holding down the left mouse button.</li></ul></li>
<li> moving, by keyboard/mouse;</li>
<li> copying and pasting — "Ctrl" + "C", "Ctrl" + "V" or from the popup menu;</li>
<li> deleting — "Del".</li></ul>
<p>To connect primitives with each other you need:
</p>
<ol><li> Press the button "Connections".</li>
<li> Select one of the figures and move its start or end point to the desired start or end point of the other figure so that it will get to the appeared circle.</li></ol>
<p>To fill the closed contour it is necessary to make double click of the left mouse button inside it or to specify the fill in the elements list as follows:
</p>
<dl><dd><i>fill:(x1:y1):(x2:y2):...:(xn:yn):color:image</i> — static;</dd>
<dd><i>fill:1:2:3:...:c1:i1</i> — dynamic.</dd></dl>
<p>Where:
</p>
<dl><dd><i>(x1:y1):(x2:y2):...:(xn:yn)</i> — coordinates of the start and end points of the primitives that form a closed contour;</dd>
<dd><i>color</i> — fill color;</dd>
<dd><i>image</i> — fill image.</dd></dl>
<p>The priority values are the color and image of the fill, set in the elements list. If you want to use the characteristics set by the "Fill" field of the "Attributes" tab, then, when describing the primitives, they should be omitted.
</p><p>To scale the figures it is necessary, in the "Geometry" field, to set the scale for the "X" and "Y" axes. In addition, there is the ability to visually zoom in/out the widget without changing the scale in the "Geometry" field. You must exit the editing mode, right click on the widget field, select in the popup menu "Zoom in (+10%)"/"Zoom out (-10%)" or rotate the mouse wheel while holding the "Ctrl" key pressed. Exit the editing mode is made either by pressing the "Esc" or using the popup menu of the widget.
</p><p>There is a possibility to rotate the content of the widget, for which it is necessary in the "Attributes" window to set "Orientation angle" from -360 to 360.
</p><p>The graphical editor supports color transparency, defined as follows: <b>{color}-{t}</b>, where <i>color</i> — the color, and <i>t</i> — transparency from 0 (fully transparent) to 255 (opaque).

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Properties_dialog_of_the_elementary_figure"><span class="mw-headline-number">5.5</span> Properties dialog of the elementary figure</span></h3>
<p>Dialog, versions of which are shown in Figures 5.5.a, 5.5.b, 5.5.c, is implemented for interactive and comfortable user control of the properties of the figure(s).

<p>As can be seen from the figures above, the dialog can be of three different forms, depending on the object for which it is called. In the title of the dialog there are the numbers of figures, for which it is called. These numbers correspond to the figures positions in the elements list, starting from the top.
</p><p>If the dialog called for a single figure (line, arc or a Bézier curve), then it is possible to edit the points' coordinates of the figure (Fig.5.5.a). If the point is connected to the point of another figure or figures, and "Connections" are enabled, then entered coordinates will be applied to all connected figures and fills, which involved the figure, will be redrawn accordingly.
</p><p>If the dialog is called for the group of selected figures (Fig.5.5.b), properties (attributes) listed in the dialog will be applied to all figures listed in the title of the dialog. When you call the dialog, in the fields of the properties will be shown the data of the figure from the group of selected ones, for which it was called the popup menu. There is the possibility to include/exclude certain properties of the dialog. For this the (<a class="image" href="http://oscada.org/wiki/File:Vision_disableButton.png"><img alt="Vision disableButton.png" height="28" src="../files/Vision_disableButton.png" width="32" /></a>) button is provided. In the case of exclusion of individual properties, they will not be processed upon acceptation of the dialog ("Ok" button). After the acceptation of the dialog, all of the data of the enabled properties will be applied to the whole group of figures.
</p><p>Dialog for the fill's properties (Fig.5.5.c) allows you to manage the properties of the specific fill.
</p><p>When selecting a check box to the right of a property, it (the property) after the acceptation of the dialog is set to the default value, which is listed in the "Attributes" tab. The "Dyn/Stat" buttons make the appropriate properties dynamic or static.

<p>To set up own behavior in non-obvious situations, the module provides the ability to configure individual parameters through the control interface of OpenSCADA (Fig.6).
</p>
<ul><li> Module state: "Running", number of individual displays in the library of Qt and main widows list.</li>
<li> Station of the VCA engine of the remote OpenSCADA and the link to the configuration page of the external OpenSCADA stations.</li>
<li> Starting user — points on behalf of what user to open the module window without requiring the password, for local station. For remote station it is points to an user different from the typical one, pointed into the host configuration.</li>
<li> User password (remote station) — password of the user different from the typical one, pointed into the host configuration.</li>
<li> Connection recovery time, in seconds — indicates the time that the lost remote connection is restored.</li>
<li> Lifetime and maximum number of the cached pages. The visualizer provides acceleration of the user interface placing previously opened pages into the cache, to control the storage time and maximum number of the pages in which this properties are intended. Indication of the zero value in general excludes cleaning the cache.</li>
<li> List of the projects for launch, separated by symbol ';', for their automatic execution with the launch of the module. To provide the possibility to indicate the opening of the window of the project execution on the desired display of many display systems, the recording format of the project "PrjName-1" is provided, where 1 — the number of the target display. To connect to the background or another open session use "<b>ses_ {SesID}</b>".</li>
<li> Exit when closing the last running project — useful for solutions that are immediately launched on the project interface.</li>
<li> Reset widget styles to common — required for some widget styles like "gtk" in some specific widgets in run mode, like buttons for the background color and images.</li></ul>
